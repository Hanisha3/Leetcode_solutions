Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

Solution
--------


class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        list1=[]
        count = 0
        diff = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i]!=0:
                count+=1
                list1.append(nums[i])
        diff = len(nums)-count
        for i in range(diff):
            list1.append(0)
        print(list1)
        for i in range(len(list1)):
            nums[i] = list1[i]
